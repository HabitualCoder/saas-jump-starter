# saas-jump-starter
A full-stack SaaS boilerplate with React, Next.js, Node.js, Supabase and TailwindCSS to launch SaaS applications quickly. The goal is to provide a clean, modular, and scalable codebase with essential SaaS features pre-configured so that you can focus on adding your own business logic instead of reinventing the wheel.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS REPOSITORY.
